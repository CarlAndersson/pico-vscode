# Raspberry Pi Pico Visual Studio Code extension

> NOTE: The extension is still under development.

This is the official Visual Studio Code extension for Raspberry Pi Pico development. It provides a set of tools to help you getting started with development for the Pico boards using Visual Studio Code and the [Pico-SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk).

[Download latest Beta RC ðŸ“€](https://github.com/paulober/vscode-raspberry-pi-pico/releases/tag/0.11.7)

## Features

- Project generator (targets ninja build-system)
- Automatic CMake configuration on project load
- Easy option to switch between different versions of the Pico-SDK and tools
- No configuration of environment variables required
- Automatic download/management of Toolchain and SDK and some tools (no separate manuall download/installation required)
- On-click project compilation per status bar button (with the selected Pico-SDK and tools)
- Offline documentation for the Pico-SDK

## Requirements by OS

> Supported Platforms: Windows x64, macOS (Sonoma and newer only), Linux x64 and arm64

- Visual Studio Code v1.87.0 or later

### macOS
All requirements for macOS can be installed by running `xcode-select --install` from Terminal
- Git (in PATH)
- Tar (in PATH)
- Native C/C++ compiler (in PATH), supported compilers are: `gcc` and `clang`

### Raspberry Pi OS
All requirements for Raspberry Pi OS can be installed by running `sudo apt install openocd ninja-build`

### Linux
- Python 3.9 or later (in PATH or set in settings)
- Git (in PATH)
- Tar (in PATH)
- Native C/C++ compiler (in PATH), supported compilers are: `gcc` and `clang`
- Ninja in PATH (arm64 only)
- \[Optional\] OpenOCD for debuging (Raspberry Pi OS only)

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `raspberry-pi-pico.cmakePath`: Set custom cmake path
* `raspberry-pi-pico.python3Path`: Set custom python3 path
* `raspberry-pi-pico.ninjaPath`: Set custom ninja path
* `raspberry-pi-pico.gitPath`: Set custom git path
* `raspberry-pi-pico.cmakeAutoConfigure`: Enable/Disable cmake auto configure on project load
* `raspberry-pi-pico.githubToken`: Set a Github personal access token (classic) with the `public_repo` scope to increase the rate limit. A GitHub personal access token (classic) with the `public_repo` scope. It is used to check GitHub for available versions of the Pico SDK and other tools.

## Known Issues

- Cannot run project generator 2 times in a row without restarting the extension
- Custom Ninja, Python3 or git paths are not stored in CMakeLists.txt like SDK and Toolchain paths so using them would require to build and configure the project thought the extension

### Github Rate Limit

If the extension fails to get available pico-sdk versions, it might be because of the Github API rate limit. You can create a personal access token (classic) with the `public_repo` and set it in the global extension settings to increase the rate limit.
